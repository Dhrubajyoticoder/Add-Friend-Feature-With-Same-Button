# Add-Friend-Feature-With-Same-Button
#using HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT
In this GitHub README status, I’ve created a simple card displaying a user named “Rob Martin” The card includes an image, the user’s name, and their relationship status (“Strangers”). There’s also a button labeled “Add Friend.” You can customize the image, name, and other details as needed. Remember to link your CSS and JavaScript files appropriately. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊
